# alt_rdb_goodtools
Alternative databases for RetroArch curated using GoodTools

These databases replace the no-intro databases already default in the RetroArch "../database/rdb" directory.
The directory scanner in the RetroArch main menus will utilize these alternative databases for rom matching
based on the crc32 values.  The convention for naming the games is different from no-intro.  A description
of the filenames can be found here:  https://emulation.gametechwiki.com/index.php/GoodTools
